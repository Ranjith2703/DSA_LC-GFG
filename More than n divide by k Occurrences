Input: arr = [3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3], k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times.

class Solution:
    
    #Function to find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times.
    def countOccurence(self,arr, k):
        #Your code here
        f={}
        for i in arr:
            if i in f:
                f[i]+=1
            else:
                f[i]=1
        s=len(arr)/k
        c=0
        for k,v in f.items():
            if v>s:
                c+=1
        return c
